          <p>The main medicine treatment for perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms is hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which replaces the hormones that are at low levels.</p> 
          <p>There are other treatments if you cannot, or chose not to, take HRT.</p>
        </section>


        <section>
          <h2>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)</h2>
          <p>HRT is a safe and effective treatment for symptoms or perimenopause and menopause.</p>
          <p>There are different types and doses of HRT. People who take the right dose and type usually find their symptoms improve.</p>
          <p>HRT involves taking oestrogen to replace your body's own levels around the time of the menopause. This can relieve many of the symptoms.</p>
          <p>Oestrogen HRT comes as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>tablets</li>
            <li>skin patches</li>
            <li>a gel or spray to put on the skin</li>
            <li>implants</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If you have a womb (uterus) you also need to take progesterone to protect your womb lining from the effects of oestrogen. Taking oestrogen and progesterone is called combined HRT.</p>
          <p>Some people also take testosterone to improve menopausal low sex drive.</p>
        </section>


        <section>
          <h3>Benefits of HRT</h3>
          <p>The main benefit of HRT is that it can help relieve most perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms, including hot flushes, brain fog, joint pains, mood swings and vaginal dryness.</p>
          <p>Hot flushes or night sweats often improve within a few weeks. Other symptoms like mood changes and vaginal dryness can take a few months to improve.</p>
          <p>Many people find their quality of life at home and at work improves when they take HRT.</p>
          <p>Taking HRT can also reduce your risk of hormone-related health problems including heart disease, osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, dementia and some types of cancer.</p>
        </section>


        <section>
          <h3>Risks of HRT</h3>
          <p>Some types of HRT can slightly increase the risk of breast cancer and blood clots in some women. You need to discuss whether you have any risk factors with a doctor or nurse.</p>
          <p>Evidence says that the risks of HRT are small and usually outweighed by the benefits.</p>

          <h2>Other medicines</h2>
          <h3>Testosterone gel for reduced sex drive</h3>
          <p>If HRT is not effective in restoring your sex drive, you might be offered a testosterone gel or cream.</p>
          <p>Testosterone is produced by the ovaries and your levels usually get lower with age.</p>
          <p>You apply the gel or cream to the skin on your tummy, top of your leg or buttocks. It can help improve sex drive, mood and energy levels. You can safely use this at the same time as HRT.</p>
          <p>Possible side effects of using testosterone, such as acne and unwanted hair growth, are uncommon. You’ll have regular blood tests to monitor your testosterone levels.</p>

          <h3>Oestrogen for vaginal dryness and discomfort</h3>
          <p>Your vagina may become dry, painful or itchy as a result of the menopause. A GP can prescribe oestrogen treatments you can insert into your vagina, in the form of a tablet, cream or ring. This can also improve any urinary symptoms.</p>
          <p>These vaginal oestrogen treatments are not absorbed into your body and only work on the bit of the body where they’re used. You can use them for as long as you want. Symptoms usually come back when you stop using them.</p>
          <p>You can safely use vaginal oestrogen with HRT.</p>
          <p>Read more about <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaginal-dryness/">vaginal dryness</a>.</p>

          <h3>Other medicines for hot flushes and night sweats</h3>
          <p>If HRT does not help with hot flushes or night sweats, you may be offered other medicines.</p>

          <h3>Antidepressants</h3>
          <p>Antidepressants can sometimes improve hot flushes and night sweats. They do not work to improve low mood caused by perimenopause or menopause.</p>
          <p>If you have clinical depression, you can safely take antidepressants with HRT.</p> 

          <h3>Clonidine</h3>
          <p>Is a medicine that can lower blood pressure. It should not be given routinely instead of HRT. Side effects of clonidine include feeling sleepy, a dry mouth and low mood.</p>

          <h3>Gabapentin</h3>
          <p>Gabapentin is an epilepsy medicine that can help with hot flushes, but it can make you feel sleepy or dizzy.</p>

          <h3>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</h3>
          <p>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy which can help with perimenopausal and menopausal low mood and anxiety. It can help with some physical symptoms like hot flushes and joint pains.</p>
          <p>You can get NHS talking therapy without going to a GP first.</p>

          <h2>Follow-up appointments</h2>
          <p>If you're having treatment for menopausal symptoms, you'll need to return to your GP for a follow-up review after 3 months, and once a year after that.</p>
          <p>During your reviews, your GP may:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>make sure your symptoms are under control</li>
            <li>ask about any side effects and bleeding patterns</li>
            <li>check your weight and blood pressure</li>
            <li>review the type of HRT you're taking and make any necessary changes</li>
            <li>discuss when you could stop treatment and how this could be done</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You may need treatment for a few years, until most of your menopausal symptoms have passed.</p>
        </section>


        <section>
          <h2>Complementary and alternative therapies</h2>
          <p>Complementary and alternative treatments, such as herbal remedies and compounded bioidentical ("natural") hormones, are not recommended for symptoms of the menopause.</p>
          <p>This is because it's not clear how safe or effective they are, and they may be harmful.</p>
          <p>Some complementary and alternative therapies can interact with other medicines and cause side effects.</p>
          <p>Ask your GP or pharmacist for advice if you're thinking about using a complementary therapy.</p>
