          <p data-block-key="wf5tn">The main treatment for menopausal symptoms is hormone replacement therapy (HRT),
            although other treatments are also available for some of the symptoms.</p>
        </section>


        <section>
          <h2 data-block-key="pbxce">Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)</h2>
          <p data-block-key="2ycdp">HRT replaces the hormones that are missing. Most symptoms are caused by low
            oestrogen levels, so this is the most important hormone to replace. If you have a womb you also need a
            progestogen to protect the lining of the womb.</p>
          <p data-block-key="8yy6y">HRT is extremely effective at relieving menopausal symptoms.</p>
          <p data-block-key="0exmh">HRT is available as tablets, skin patches, a gel to rub into the skin&nbsp;or
            implants.</p>
          <h3 data-block-key="gfew2">Benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy (HRT)</h3>
          <p data-block-key="qdt4j">The main benefit of HRT is that it can help relieve most <a
              href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/menopause/symptoms/">menopausal symptoms</a>, including hot flushes,
            brain fog, joint pains, mood swings and vaginal dryness.</p>
          <p data-block-key="xtmm7">It can also help prevent thinning of the bones, which can lead to fractures
            (osteoporosis). Osteoporosis is more common after the menopause.</p>
          <p>Some types of HRT can slightly increase the risk of breast cancer and blood clots in
            some women. You need to discuss whether you have any risk factors with a doctor or nurse.</p>
          <p>Evidence says that the risks of HRT are small and usually outweighed by the
            benefits.</p>
          <p>Your GP can give you more information about the risks and benefits of HRT to help
            you decide whether or not you want to take it.</p>

          <h2 data-block-key="iq125">Hot flushes and night sweats</h2>
          <p data-block-key="9gpkj">If you experience <a href="/conditions/menopause/hot-flushes/">hot flushes</a> and
            <a href="/conditions/night-sweats/">night sweats</a> as a result of the menopause, simple measures may
            sometimes help, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li data-block-key="qgwln">wearing light clothing</li>
            <li data-block-key="oi8sw">keeping your bedroom cool at night</li>
            <li data-block-key="p4vgv">taking a cool shower, using a fan or having a cold drink</li>
            <li data-block-key="lvvk5">trying to&nbsp;<a
                href="/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/understanding-stress/">reduce your stress levels</a></li>
            <li data-block-key="x53at">avoiding potential triggers, such as spicy food, caffeine,&nbsp;smoking and
              alcohol</li>
            <li data-block-key="g9fub">taking regular&nbsp;<a

                href="https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/lose-weight/">losing weight</a> if you're overweight</li>
          </ul>
          <p data-block-key="g215t">If the flushes and sweats are frequent or severe, your GP may suggest taking HRT.
          </p>
          <p data-block-key="7d4y4">If HRT isn't suitable for you, or you would prefer not to have it, your GP may
            recommend other medicines that can help, such as clonidine (a <a
              href="/conditions/high-blood-pressure-hypertension/">high blood pressure</a>&nbsp;medicine)&nbsp;or
            certain <a href="/conditions/antidepressants/">antidepressants</a>.</p>
          <p data-block-key="ktkdx">These medicines can&nbsp;cause unpleasant side effects, so it's important to discuss
            the risks and benefits with your doctor before starting treatment.</p>

          <h2 data-block-key="plgbt">Mood changes</h2>
          <p data-block-key="i77pu">Some women experience mood swings, low mood and anxiety around the time of the
            menopause.</p>
          <p data-block-key="68fgm">Self-help measures such as getting plenty of rest, taking regular exercise and doing
            relaxing activities such as <a href="/live-well/exercise/guide-to-yoga/">yoga</a>&nbsp;and <a
              href="/live-well/exercise/guide-to-tai-chi/">tai chi</a>&nbsp;may help. Medicine and other treatments are
            also available, including HRT and <a href="/conditions/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/">cognitive
              behavioural therapy (CBT)</a>.</p>
          <p data-block-key="7ld08">CBT is a type of talking therapy that can improve low mood and feelings of anxiety.
            Your GP may be able to refer you for CBT on the NHS, or recommend self-help options such as online CBT
            courses.</p>
          <p data-block-key="ls2vb">Antidepressants may&nbsp;help if you've been diagnosed with <a

        <section>
          <h2 data-block-key="fkhmu">Reduced sexual desire</h2>
          <p data-block-key="gttbm">It's common for women to lose interest in sex around the time of the menopause, but
            HRT can often help with this. If HRT is not effective, you might be offered a testosterone gel to apply to
            an area of skin, such as your tummy or the top of your leg.</p>
          <p data-block-key="6lz3d">Testosterone is the male sex hormone, and it can help restore sex drive in some
            women. It's not currently licensed for use in women, although it can be prescribed after the menopause by a
            specialist doctor if they think it might help restore your sex drive.</p>
          <p data-block-key="pv3gp">Possible side effects of using testosterone include&nbsp;<a
              href="/conditions/acne/">acne</a> and <a href="/conditions/hirsutism/">unwanted hair growth</a>.</p>

          <h2 data-block-key="0rpe4">Vaginal dryness and discomfort</h2>
          <p data-block-key="sgsgb">If&nbsp;your vagina becomes dry, painful or itchy as a result of the menopause, your
            GP can prescribe oestrogen treatment that's&nbsp;put directly into your vagina as a pessary, cream or
            vaginal ring.</p>
          <p data-block-key="hm99s">This can safely be used alongside HRT.</p>
          <p data-block-key="0ov8o">You'll usually need to use vaginal oestrogen indefinitely, as your symptoms are
            likely to return when treatment stops. However, side effects are very rare.</p>
          <p data-block-key="bq8pe">You can also use over-the-counter vaginal moisturisers or lubricants in addition to,
            or instead of, vaginal oestrogen.</p>

            weak bones that may break more easily (<a href="/conditions/osteoporosis/">osteoporosis</a>) as a result of

          <h2>Complementary and alternative therapies</h2>
          <p>Complementary and alternative treatments, such as herbal remedies and bioidentical
            ("natural")&nbsp;hormones, are not recommended for symptoms of the menopause. This is because it's generally unclear how safe and effective they are.</p>
          <p>Bioidentical hormones are not the same as body identical hormones. Body identical hormones, or micronised progesterone, can be prescribed to treat menopausal symptoms.</p>
          <p>Some complementary and alternative therapies&nbsp;can also&nbsp;interact with other medicines and cause side effects.</p>
          <p>Ask your GP or pharmacist for advice if you're thinking about using a complementary therapy.</p>
